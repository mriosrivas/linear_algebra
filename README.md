# linear_algebra

This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks for using and testing the Mayavi library for my Linear Algebra course.

There are several ways you can run these notebooks:

1. Using Binder. Just go to https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mriosrivas/linear_algebra/master and play on line with it.
2. Locally using Anaconda and the `local_environment.yml` .  Just type `conda env create -f local_environment.yml`
3. Locally running Docker. Just type `docker build https://github.com/mriosrivas/3d_graphics.git#master`
